# Welcome!
Hello there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Ro, and I contributes nothing to the internet. I code basically everyday, from personal projects, to public projects, to repositories, basically everything I do.

I have made a number of websites, all of which you can find [here](https://5qc.github.io/website-list.txt) (rarely gets updated). I also have a number of websites and projects coming soon to a domain near you. If you want to see my hub where I put some of my coding projects, see [here](//www.roc0ast3r.dev).

I have no idea what else to put on this readme, so I guess enjoy looking at my terrible code and improve them while you like, I don't know.
