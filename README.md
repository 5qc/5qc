# Welcome!
Hello there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Ronin (better known online as **roc0ast3r** or **5qc**), the person that contributes nothing to the internet. I code basically everyday, from personal projects, to public projects, to repositories, basically everything I do.

I have made a number of websites, all of which you can find [here](https://5qc.github.io/website-list.txt). I also have a number of websites and projects coming soon to a domain near you. I'm also currently working on a hub for all of my coding projects (+ a coding blog).

I have no idea what else to put on this readme, so I guess enjoy looking at my terrible code and improve them while you like, I don't know.
